#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, you will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, you will take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. You will also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

### How to run it?

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Go inside the directory with a terminal and launch a local client server using Python with the following command: 
      python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
3. Go to your browser and access to the following address: http://localhost:8000

NOTE: Check in your terminal which version do you have of python with: python -V. If not, download python to your computer.

### What I did?

1. To make the site responsive with different sizes using media(max-width), responsive sizes, flex, etc.
2. Give accessibility with tabs, name to the HTML file.
3. Create ServiceWorker for using the cache to see the page in offline mode. For it I use mostly this following webpage for information: https://css-tricks.com/serviceworker-for-offline/
